🎵 Songs Management Application – C++ & Qt
🔹 A sophisticated C++ application with a Qt-powered GUI for managing a collection of songs.
🔹 Built following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase.

🚀 Why This Project?
✅ Interactive Qt GUI – A user-friendly interface for managing songs
✅ Object-Oriented Design – Structured and scalable architecture
✅ CRUD Operations – Create, Read, Update, and Delete song entries
✅ File-Based Storage – Persistent data between sessions
✅ Industry-Ready Code – Clean, maintainable, and efficient

🛠️ Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
🖥️ C++	Core programming language
🎨 Qt Framework	GUI development using Qt Designer
🗂️ File Handling	Data storage in input.txt
🏗️ OOP Principles	Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
⚡ STL (Vectors)	Efficient data management
🎯 Project Features
🔹 1. Object-Oriented Architecture (OOP)
💡 Encapsulation: Data members are private, accessed through getters/setters
💡 Inheritance: GUI, Service, and Repository layers follow a structured hierarchy
💡 Polymorphism: Function overloading for flexible operations

🔹 2. Elegant Qt GUI
✨ Built with Qt Designer for a modern and smooth user experience
✨ Dynamic UI elements for managing songs
✨ Event-driven interactions for intuitive use

🔹 3. File-Based Storage System
📁 Persistent Data: Songs are saved in input.txt
📁 Fast Data Retrieval: Implemented using fstream
📁 No Database Needed: Simple yet effective storage solution
